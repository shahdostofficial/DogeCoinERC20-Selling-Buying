# DogeCoinERC20-Selling-Buying
The Dogecoin smart contract is an ERC20-based token that allows users to buy and sell Dogecoin tokens. It provides a seamless and secure way for users to transact with Dogecoin within the Ethereum ecosystem. The contract includes all the standard ERC20 token functionalities, such as transferring tokens between addresses, checking balances, and approving token allowances.

In addition to the basic ERC20 functionality, the smart contract introduces buying and selling features. Users can buy Dogecoin tokens by sending Ether to the contract. The contract ensures that the transaction meets certain conditions, such as the availability of tokens and the specified purchase price. Once the purchase is successful, the corresponding amount of Dogecoin tokens is transferred to the buyer's address, and the Ether used for the purchase, along with a fixed commission, is transferred to the owner's address.

Similarly, users can sell their Dogecoin tokens back to the contract. The contract verifies the availability of tokens and the requested selling price before initiating the transaction. Once the sale is completed, the Dogecoin tokens are transferred from the seller's address to the contract, and the corresponding amount of Ether, minus the fixed commission, is sent back to the seller.

One notable feature of this smart contract is the fixed commission charged by the owner for each transaction. This commission is similar to the fees imposed by popular cryptocurrency exchanges and swap platforms. The commission provides an incentive for the owner to maintain and support the Dogecoin ecosystem while ensuring a sustainable revenue stream.

By incorporating these buying and selling functionalities along with a fixed commission, the Dogecoin smart contract empowers users to easily trade Dogecoin tokens on the Ethereum network while generating income for the owner. This contract facilitates a seamless and efficient exchange of value, fostering liquidity and accessibility for the Dogecoin community within the broader Ethereum ecosystem.
